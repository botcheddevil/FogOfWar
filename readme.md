# Ultra-Optimized WebSocket Chess System

A highly optimized chess system demonstrating extreme efficiency in state management and real-time gameplay, capable of supporting 10,000+ concurrent games on minimal hardware.

## Key Features

- **Ultra-Efficient State Management**

  - Complete board state in 25 bytes
  - Session management in 18 bytes
  - Move deltas in 2 bytes per move
  - Total game footprint ~143 bytes

- **Scalability**

  - 10,000+ concurrent games on a single $5 VPS
  - Minimal memory footprint (~1KB per active game)
  - Optimized WebSocket implementation
  - Low-latency move processing

- **Technical Implementation**
  - Custom binary protocol for state transmission
  - Efficient move validation
  - Real-time game state synchronization
  - Memory-optimized data structures

## System Architecture
